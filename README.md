Tumors Classification
Machine Learning | Python
• Collected Breast Cancer Data with 569 instances and analyzed the features of cell nuclei with common statistical measures
• Prepared data with standardization and encoding and split the data into training and test datasets
• Trained ML models with three classification methods (SVC, Logistic Regression, and Random Decision Forest)
• Utilized cross-validation to adjust the parameters for each model
• Presented test results and relevant applications to WAMM (Women in Applied Math Mentoring)

Advisor: Dr. Ying-Jen Yang, Laufer Center for Physical and Quantitative Biology, Stony Brook University
• Built a continuous-time Markov chain model to describe the dynamics of neurotransmitter
• Used Gillespie algorithm to generate stochastic trajectories of transmitter populations
• Analyzed the statistical properties of the transmitter populations
• Used information theory and stochastic thermodynamics to analyze information encoding and energetics of the transmitter dynamics
